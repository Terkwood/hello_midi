# hello_midi

Starter project for MIDI with rust.

## Usage

We recommend downloading the JS Bach Goldberg Variations from https://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/.

```sh
cargo run ~/Documents/Goldberg_Variations.mid
```

## Mac Config

* Install SimpleSynth according to https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/wiki/MIDI-playback-on-Mac-OS-X

## MIDI sample data

We ran [rimd](https://github.com/RustAudio/rimd) test bin against the Goldberg Variations and found a lot of Note On events.

```sh
% cargo run --bin test # rimd

We can see by reading http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/formats/midi-event.html that most of these are "Channel 1 Note On".

## Using SoundFlower to record MIDI

Not strictly related to the build, but...

This is helpful for redirecting your successful
playback of MIDI to a sound file that you're recording.
